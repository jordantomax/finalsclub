            <p>
              Pearl has been consumed since ancient in China, Egypt and India, as rare jewel powder</br>
              Pearl Powder had been the most sought after and expensive Chinese medicine, </br>
              and was used by only royal families for over 2000 years.

            <p>
              Pearl powder has large amounts of calcium, and other minerals like</br>
              iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc, combined with conchiolin. Conchiolin is the "gift for beauty", </br>
              and contains 18 amino acids that are necessary for the human body.</br>
              It has been a popular beauty ingredient, used to make cosmetics and supplements since long ago.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern Research has shown that with the richness</br>
              of the amino acids, and minerals, pearl powder is expected to cure inflammation,</br>
              relieve pain, regenerate tissue and accelerate wound healing, rejuvenate skin</br>
              to have a tender, smooth and delicate appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
